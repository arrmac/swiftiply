Swiftiply v. 0.5.0

Swiftiply is a clustering proxy for web applications.  It is intended to be
a backend agnostic clustering proxy that is specifically designed to support
HTTP traffic from web frameworks. Unlike Pen (http://siag.nu/pen/), Swiftiply
is not intended as a general purpose load balancer for tcp protocols.  Unlike
HAProxy (http://haproxy.1wt.eu/) it is not a highly configurable general
purpose proxy overflowing with features.

What it is, though, is a very fast, narrowly targetted clustering proxy.
In back to back comparisons of Swiftiply to HAProxy, Swiftiply reliably
outperforms HAProxy (tested using IOWA backend processes).
