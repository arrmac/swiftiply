Swiftiply v. 0.5.0

Swiftiply is a backend agnostic clustering proxy for web applications that is
specifically designed to support HTTP traffic from web frameworks. Unlike Pen
(http://siag.nu/pen/), Swiftiply is not intended as a general purpose load
balancer for tcp protocols and unlike HAProxy (http://haproxy.1wt.eu/), it is
not a highly configurable general purpose proxy overflowing with features.

What it is, though, is a very fast, narrowly targetted clustering proxy.
In back to back comparisons of Swiftiply to HAProxy, Swiftiply reliably
outperforms HAProxy (tested using IOWA, Rails, and Ramaze backend processes).
